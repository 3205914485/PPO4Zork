This could provide new clues or items to help solve puzzles or advance the game.\n\n- **Check the Jeweled Egg**:\n  - Since you have the jewel-encrusted egg, it might be a good idea to try to examine it or see if anything interesting happens when you interact with it.\n\n- **Search for Clues**:\n  - Look around the clearing to see if there\n\n--- Goal ---\nExamine the jewel-encrusted egg and explore the area around the clearing.\n\n--- Candidate Actions ---\ntake on egg\nput down egg\nput down leaves\nput down all\nput egg in grating\nthrow egg at grating\nthrow leaves at egg\nopen egg with leaves\nsouth\nwest\neast\n\nNow select your action from belows within an <answer>...</answer> block:",
