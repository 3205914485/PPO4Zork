Continue exploring the Forest\n2. Check if there's a path to go east to the Forest Path\n3. Look around to see if there are any hidden areas or items\n\nConsidering the current situation and known information:\n\n1. The observation clearly states that \"Storm-tossed trees block your way\", which means you cannot proceed directly east towards the Forest Path. This suggests that the area beyond the storm-tossed trees might be inaccessible or dangerous at this moment.\n\n2. Checking the available exits confirms that there's no direct path south to the Clearing, which was visited earlier. This implies that the Clearing may not be accessible from this position due to the storm-tossed trees blocking the way.\n\n3. Given that you've already explored most of the rooms and have an inventory with a leaflet, it's worth considering if the leaflet might contain useful information about navigating through the storm-tossed trees or revealing an alternative route.\n\nBased on these considerations, the best course of action would be:\n\n**Consider 3: Look around to see if there are any hidden areas or items**\n\nExploring further within the Forest might reveal new paths, items, or information about the storm-tossed trees.

Based on the information provided:\n\n1. You are currently in the Kitchen.\n2. Your inventory contains only \"lunch\".\n3. The action \"check\" returned a response saying there's nothing to check.\n\nGiven this, it seems that \"check\" is a verb that doesn't work as expected in this context. You're not being asked to inspect something tangible like an item in your inventory, but rather something else that could be checked or examined.\n\nConsidering the context, a logical next step might be to try to find out more about the kitchen itself or its contents. You could use \"look\" to see if there's anything noteworthy about the room, or perhaps try to interact with the walls or floor (if possible) to see if anything can be checked.\n\nNext steps could be:\n- Look around the Kitchen\n- Examine the walls or floor of the Kitchen\n\nIf these actions still don't reveal anything, you may want to explore other rooms you've visited to gather more information or items. \n\nSo, my recommendation would be:\n\"look\"\nor\n\"examine walls\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to generate any\n\n--- Goal ---\nLook around the Kitchen and examine the walls/floor\n\n--- Candidate Actions ---\njump\neast\ntake bottle\ntake sack\ntake garlic\ntake all\nup\nclose bottle\nclose sack\nclose window\nput down food\nput food in sack\nput food on table\nwest\n\nNow select your action from belows within an <answer>...</answer> block:",
