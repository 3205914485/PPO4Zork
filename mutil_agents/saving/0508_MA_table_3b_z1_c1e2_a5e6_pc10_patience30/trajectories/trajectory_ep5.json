Based on your current situation and memory, you are in the \"Behind House\" room and cannot find a mailbox. You've already visited other rooms including the \"Forest Path,\" \"North House,\" and \"West House,\" but not the \"Behind House.\" Since you haven't explored this room yet and have no exits listed for it, it's likely that the mailbox is not present here. \n\nTo proceed, you should try to explore the \"Behind House\" room by taking an exit. According to your memory, there is an exit to the \"North House\" to the west. Let's check if there are any clues or items in this room that might help you find a mailbox or another location where one could be found.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Go west** into the \"North House\" room to see if you encounter anything useful there or if you can find a way out to look for a mailbox elsewhere.\n2. If there are no obvious exits from \"Behind House,\" you might need to search the room for any hidden compartments or objects that could provide more information.\n\nSo, I would recommend going west into the \"North House\" to investigate further.

You might find clues about items, puzzles, or enemies that could help you progress.\n\n2. **Interact with Items in the 'Living' Room**: If there are any items present in the 'Living' room, try interacting with them. This might involve taking an item if it's something you can carry, using a tool if it’s a weapon, or attempting to open a door if there’s one.\n\n3. **Check Inventory**: Before entering the new room, ensure your inventory is updated.

Based on your current situation, let's analyze what actions you can take:\n\n1. **West Exit**: You can go west into North House. This is a logical step since you have an exit in that direction and it's one of the rooms you've visited. \n\n2. **South Exit**: Similarly, you can go south into South House. Again, you've visited this room and there's a valid exit in that direction.\n\n3. **North Exit**: Going north would bring you back to North House, which you've already explored. This might not provide new information or items but could be useful if you're exploring systematically.\n\nConsidering the items you carry (brass lantern, glass bottle, sword, brown sack) and your knowledge of the rooms you've visited, going west into North House seems like a reasonable choice. It's likely to provide more exploration opportunities without repeating what you've already seen.\n\n**Action to Take**: Go west into North House.\n```markdown\nGo west → North House\n```\n\n--- Goal ---\nExamine the Strange Gothic Lettering on the Wooden Door in the North House and West House.\n\n--- Candidate Actions ---\nwest\nput out lantern\ntake garlic\nclose bottle\nclose sack\nclose window\nput down lantern\nput down sword\nput down bottle\nput down sack\nput down garlic\nput down all\nsouth\nshake sack\nput bottle in sack\nthrow lantern at sword\nnorth\neast\n\nNow select your action from belows within an <answer>...</answer> block:",

Confirm your location:\n   - Type \"I am in a(n) ___\" (fill in with 'Living' or 'Kitchen') to verify where you are.\n   \n2. If you are in the 'Kitchen':\n   - Try using the room name explicitly instead of \"east\". For example, type \"go kitchen\" or \"move kitchen\".\n\n3.

The sword could be useful for combat if you encounter enemies, though Zork doesn't typically have combat unless you explicitly choose to fight. The lantern can help with visibility, and the sack might hold important items.\n\n3. **Useful Items**:\n   - Consider using the lantern to light up the area and possibly see hidden passages or clues. The glass bottle could also be useful for gathering resources or crafting potions if you find one.\n   - The brown sack might contain items you need or want to carry.

Here's what you can do next:\n\n1. **Explore the Trophy Case:** The trophy case might contain useful items or clues about how to get to the basement. Check it out.\n\n2. **Examine the Strange Door:** The door to the west has strange gothic lettering that appears to be nailed shut. You might want to try breaking it down, but remember that this could alert any nearby monsters.\n\n3. **Use the Garlic:** The clove of garlic you found in the brown sack could potentially be used as a defense against monsters. However, you should use it sparingly since it might not last long.\n\n4. **Check the Brass Lantern:** Although it’s battery-powered, it might still have some utility. Consider whether it would be useful to light a way for yourself.\n\n5. **Look at the Rug:** The large oriental rug might provide cover or have hidden compartments. Examine it closely.\n\n6. **Inventory Check:** Ensure you have the glass bottle in your inventory, as it might come in handy later.\n\n--- Goal ---\nExamine the trophy case\n\n--- Candidate Actions ---\nblow out lantern\ntake sack\ntake garlic\ntake lantern\ntake all\nclose sack\nclose case\nclose bottle\nput down bottle\npush rug\nput bottle in sack\nput bottle in case\nthrow water at lantern\nfill case with bottle\neast\n\nNow select your action from belows within an <answer>...</answer> block:",

Each time you entered a new room, you looked around. The first time you looked in 'Behind House', it was just a small house with some tools stored inside. The second time you looked in 'Forest Path', there were several trees and bushes, and you noticed a brown sack near the path. The third time you looked in 'Kitchen', it seemed like someone had been here recently - dishes were still on the counter and the floor was dirty. You also saw a glass bottle on the table.
