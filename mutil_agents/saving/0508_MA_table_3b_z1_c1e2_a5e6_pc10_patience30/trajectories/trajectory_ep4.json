The mailbox here contains a note which says, \"For Roger.\" There's a locked chest inside the house. You haven't found a key yet, but you suspect it might be hidden in the field or house. Your task is to enter the house and find the key to the chest, then use the key to unlock the chest and retrieve its contents.

Here’s what you can do next:\n\n1. **Examine the Mailbox**: \n   - Read the note inside the mailbox to see if there is any information related to Roger or hints about the chest or key. This might provide crucial clues about the location or how to proceed further.\n\n2. **Examine the House**:\n   - Since there's no information about a key in the mailbox, you should try entering the house to explore further.

Investigated the trophy case.\nTo better understand what's happening in this situation, let's break down your actions and observations:\n\n1. **Examining the Wooden Door**: You noted that it's nailed shut and has strange gothic lettering. This suggests it might be a locked door or a secret passage.\n\n2. **Investigating the Trophy Case**: The sword and lantern were mentioned here. The lantern is still on the trophy case, but you used a glass bottle on it (action 4), which seems like it may have altered its functionality.\n\n3. **Taking the Glass Bottle**: You removed the glass bottle from your inventory.

Here’s why:\n- It aligns with the typical gameplay pattern of exploring all accessible areas.\n- You've already covered the immediate surroundings, so there may be more to discover here.\n- The
