Look around for anything unusual or useful.\n\n2. **Look for Clues:** Pay attention to any signs, messages, or objects that might give you hints about the next steps or directions to take.\n\n3. **Check Boundaries:** If the room seems too small or you feel like you might be missing something, try checking the walls or corners of the room to ensure nothing is hidden.\n\n4. **Ask the AI (if applicable):** If the game allows, you could try asking the AI for more information about this room or where to go next.\n\n5. **Wait and Watch:** Sometimes games provide clues through interactions with objects or environmental changes.

Look around for anything unusual or useful.\n\n2. **Look for Clues:** Pay attention to any signs, messages, or objects that might give you hints about the next steps or directions to take.\n\n3. **Check Boundaries:** If the room seems too small or you feel like you might be missing something, try checking the walls or corners of the room to ensure nothing is hidden.\n\n4. **Ask the AI (if applicable):** If the game allows, you could try asking the AI for more information about this room or where to go next.\n\n5. **Wait and Watch:** Sometimes games provide clues through interactions with objects or environmental changes. If nothing happens immediately, wait a moment and observe the room.\n\nGiven the limited information, the best initial action would be to explore the room thoroughly.

For example, you might use a book as a weapon, or a chair to climb over obstacles.\n\n5. **Look for Hidden Items**: Sometimes items or traps are hidden.

It could contain clues or directions for the game's progression.\n- **Check the Room**: Since there isn't much to find in the room itself (you've already been there), examining the leaflet might be worthwhile.\n- **Go North**: There's no other exit available, so moving north to the North House would be logical next step if the leaflet provides useful information.\n\n--- Previous Goal

It could contain clues or directions for the game's progression.\n- **Check the Room**: Since there isn't much to find in the room itself (you've already been there), examining the leaflet might be worthwhile.\n- **Go North**: There's no other exit available, so moving north to the North House would be logical next step if the leaflet provides useful information.\n\n--- Goal ---\nExamine the leaflet and move north to the North House.\n\n--- Candidate Actions ---\nclose mailbox\nput down leaflet\nnorth\nput leaflet in mailbox\nsouth\nwest\n\nNow select your action from belows within an <answer>...</answer> block:",

If you don't see one directly, look for any other paths or areas you haven't visited yet.\n\n5\n\n--- Goal ---\nGiven your current situation in the Forest Path, the following steps seem logical:\n\n1. **Examine the Tree**: Start by carefully examining the large tree. There may be useful items, a hidden passage, or even some sort of mechanism that could lead to an exit.\n\n2. **Check the Ground and Surrounding Area**: After examining the tree, look around the immediate area for any clues or hidden items. Pay attention to the ground as well as any structures or natural formations that might be overlooked.\n\n3. **Look for Signs of Recent Activity**: Check for any signs that someone has been in the area recently, such as footprints, tools, or discarded items. This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\n\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\n\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\n\n6. **Use Inventory\n\n--- Candidate Actions ---\nup\nput down leaflet\ngo around forest\nnorth\nsouth\nwest\neast\n\nNow select your action from belows within an <answer>...</answer> block:",

This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings']\n\nNow write your planning analysis, then end with:\n<goal>your short goal here</goal>",

Your inventory contains only a leaflet.\n3. You have visited several locations including 'Forest', 'North House', and 'West House', but you haven't explored 'Behind House'.\n4. The only known exit from your current location is to the 'Forest Path' in the east direction.\n\nGiven this information, let's consider some actions:\n\n- **Explore the Forest Path:** This would likely lead to new locations and potentially uncover more about the forest and the overall map of the game world. It's a logical step forward.\n\n**Action:** \"I head east towards the Forest Path.\"\n\n**Result:** As you move east along the path, you might encounter new areas or characters. The Forest Path could lead you to interesting spots within the forest, such as a clearing with trees or a small stream. Alternatively, it could lead to a dead end or a way back to other areas you've already visited. \n\nTo proceed further, we need to choose a specific action on the Forest Path.

What do you do?\nIn this scenario, you're in a clearing surrounded by a dense forest and there's a path leading south that you haven't explored yet. Given your current location and inventory, it seems logical to take the path south to see where it leads.\n\nHere’s what I would suggest:\n\n**Action:** Go south to the Forest Path\n\n**Explanation:** \n- **Exploration Opportunity:** The path leading south might lead to new areas or provide information about the environment beyond the clearing.\n- **Inventory Consideration:** You have an inventory item called \"leaflet,\" which could be useful if you encounter something related to reading or if there's information hidden somewhere.\n- **Safety:** It's important to move cautiously as forests can be home to various creatures, though you've not encountered any yet.\n\nAfter taking the path south, you should update your observations and possibly add new rooms to your list of visited ones. For example, if you enter a house or discover something interesting at the end of the path, you'll want to note these details in your memory.\n\nSo, your next step is:\n**Go south to the Forest Path**. \n\nThis action will help you progress further into the game world and gather more information about your surroundings.

You seem to be at a clearing with forest nearby. You can move south to explore the path leading to the forest.\n2. Your inventory includes a leaflet, but you haven't used it yet.\n3. You've already explored the forest (North House, West House) and the house behind you.\n4. The command \"south\" doesn't make sense as a direction within this clearing. Perhaps you meant \"go south,\" or \"move south.\"\n\nGiven this context, what should you do next? Consider the implications of each action.\nBased on the information provided, the most logical course of action would be to take the \"south\" exit to explore the Forest Path. Since you're in a clearing and the only direction indicated for movement is south, you should proceed south to see where this leads. \n\nHere’s why:\n- You have not explored the Forest Path yet.\n- The leaflet in your inventory hasn’t been used, so there's no indication that its use is required before exploring the area.\n- Moving south aligns with the only clear direction available in your

could provide us with crucial clues or directions.\n\n2. **Take the leaflet**: If it contains information or hints about how to proceed, taking it might be useful.\n\n3. **Inspect the bottle**: Since it contains water, we could drink it to quench our thirst, but that's not necessarily the best use of time unless we're really thirsty.\n\n4. **\n\n--- Previous Goal ---\n['Re-examine the mailbox and

Look around the kitchen to see if there's anything out of place or if there are items that seem misplaced.\n\n2. **Examine the Room Thoroughly**: Check under tables, chairs, or any other furniture. Look in drawers, cabinets, or on shelves. Also, check any pockets of the brown sack in your inventory to see if they contain the item you dropped.\n\n3. **Look for Clues**: If you found the item, look around the room to see if there are any clues or hints about what caused you to drop it.

Given your current situation and the information you have, it seems like you are in a kitchen and your inventory includes a brown sack. Your only known exit from this room is to the east, which leads to a place called \"Behind House\". \n\nSince you mentioned not knowing the word \"---\" in your observation, I'm going to assume that you might have encountered an unrecognized command or input error. It would be prudent to try to move in the direction you know you can go first, then if necessary, you can explore further or look for more commands.\n\nGiven this context, I recommend moving east towards the \"Behind House\":\n```\neast\n```\n\nIf you encounter any specific words or actions related to the \"Behind House\" that you're unsure about, you can ask for clarification. For example:\n```\nlook\n```\n\nor\n```\nexamine Behind House\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to progress step-by-step while keeping track of your movements and actions. If you find yourself at a dead end or unable to proceed, you can backtrack to the last known safe area (the Kitchen) and reassess your situation. \n\nLet's start by moving east

Pay attention to the ground as well as any structures or natural formations that might be overlooked.\\n\\n3. **Look for Signs of Recent Activity**: Check for any signs that someone has been in the area recently, such as footprints, tools, or discarded items. This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\\n\\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Based on the current situation in the kitchen, there is a brown sack with a strong pepper smell that could contain valuable items or clues.
