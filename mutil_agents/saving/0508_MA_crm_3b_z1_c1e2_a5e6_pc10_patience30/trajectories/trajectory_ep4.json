Pay attention to the ground as well as any structures or natural formations that might be overlooked.\\n\\n3. **Look for Signs of Recent Activity**: Check for any signs that someone has been in the area recently, such as footprints, tools, or discarded items. This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\\n\\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Based on the current situation in the kitchen, there is a brown sack with a strong pepper smell that could contain valuable items or clues.

Given the limited inventory and the fact that neither room has provided any clues, let's think through possible actions:\n\n1. **Examine the doors**: Since you've already checked both rooms (North House and West House), examining the doors might give you some information about their nature (e.g., locked/unlocked).\n2. **Check inventory**: Double-check your inventory for any items that could be useful (e.g., keys, tools).\n3. **Look around**: Sometimes there are small details in the environment that aren't immediately obvious but can lead to important discoveries.\n\nConsidering these points, a good step would be to:\n- **Examine the south door**: See if it's locked or unlocked and try to figure out how to open it (if it's not already clear).\n- **Examine the west door**: Similarly, check if this door leads to somewhere interesting or if it needs a key.\n\n--- Previous Goal ---\n['Re-examine the mailbox and search the immediate area', 'Search for the hidden passage

Pay attention to the ground as well as any structures or natural formations that might be overlooked.\\n\\n3. **Look for Signs of Recent Activity**: Check for any signs that someone has been in the area recently, such as footprints, tools, or discarded items. This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\\n\\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Based on the current situation in the kitchen, there is a brown sack with a strong pepper smell that could contain valuable items or clues.

Pay attention to the ground as well as any structures or natural formations that might be overlooked.\\n\\n3. **Look for Signs of Recent Activity**: Check for any signs that someone has been in the area recently, such as footprints, tools, or discarded items. This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\\n\\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Based on the current situation in the kitchen, there is a brown sack with a strong pepper smell that could contain valuable items or clues.

This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\\n\\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Based on the current situation in the kitchen, there is a brown sack with a strong pepper smell that could contain valuable items or clues.

Since you haven't explored much of the area, it seems logical to try a general search for items or clues, or possibly interact with an object or NPC if one exists in the Forest.\n\nA good approach would be to **search** the room. This could reveal any hidden objects, items, or clues that might help you progress further in the game. If there are no obvious exits or items, you could also try **exploring** by checking nearby rooms, which means visiting the adjacent rooms one by one until you find a way out or discover something

in the Forest Path, the following steps seem logical:\\n\\n1. **Examine the Tree**: Start by carefully examining the large tree. There may be useful items, a hidden passage, or even some sort of mechanism that could lead to an exit.\\n\\n2. **Check the Ground and Surrounding Area**: After examining the tree, look around the immediate area for any clues or hidden items. Pay attention to the ground as well as any structures or natural formations that might be overlooked.\\n\\n3. **Look for Signs of Recent Activity**: Check for any signs that someone has been in the area recently, such as footprints, tools, or discarded items. This could indicate a path or a clue about how to proceed.\\n\\n4. **Explore the Immediate Area Further**: If the tree doesn’t yield any significant information, expand your exploration of the immediate area. This includes looking at the low branches of the tree, checking nearby foliage, and examining the terrain for any hidden passageways.\\n\\n5. **Consider Other Potential Directions**: While you have already explored south and there appears to be no other exit from the current path, it’s worth double-checking if there are any minor twists or turns in the forest path that you might have missed.\\n\\n6. **Use Inventory', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Examine the tree and check the ground and surroundings', 'Your short goal here', 'Based on the current situation in the kitchen, there is a brown sack with a strong pepper smell that could contain valuable items or clues.

Here are some steps to consider:\n\n1. **Explore the Forest**: Given you're in the Forest, it seems like a good idea to wander a bit and see if you come across any other rooms or areas.\n\n2. **Check for Hidden Passages**: Sometimes in games, there can be hidden passages or tunnels under or through trees that lead to new areas. Try walking around and look for such signs or clues.\n\n3. **Look for Signs**: Check if there are any signs, messages, or clues left by previous players or NPCs that could guide you to something interesting.\n\n4. **Examine the Environment**: Look around for anything out of the ordinary, such as strange plants, animal tracks, or any unusual objects that might have been left behind.\n\n5. **Inventory Check**: Since you mentioned having \"Nothing\" in your inventory, make sure you check again to see if anything has changed.
