You have several options based on your memory of the visited rooms:\n\n1. **Explore North**: Since there is a clear exit to the north leading to the 'Clearing', you might want to investigate this area further. The 'Clearing' was one of the rooms you visited, so it could provide additional clues or items.\n\n2. **Investigate West**: There is also an exit to the west leading to the 'Forest'. Exploring the 'Forest' might give you insights into how to proceed further into the game world, as well as potentially finding more information or resources.\n\n3. **Use Your Leaflet**: Given that you have a leaflet in your inventory, it's worth considering if it can be used in any way.
